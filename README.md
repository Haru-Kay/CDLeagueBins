This repository was created to pull game files directly from League of Legends and League of Legends (PBE).

There are multiple instances of me using my own system files here so if you would like to clone the repo please make sure you're modifying the file locations needed. I will not provide hash files.

`bincompile.rb` takes an optional argument for the filepath, leading to the file location where `Game` is located. Your own install location can be specified there in the bat files.

[wadtools](https://github.com/LeagueToolkit/wadtools) requires hash files to function, more can be found in that repo.

[ritobin](https://github.com/moonshadow565/ritobin) requires hash files to function, but can actually be overwritten in the commandline.
