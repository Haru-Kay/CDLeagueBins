Look at what we accomplished together! Defeating a skyscraper-sized Primordian leading a full-scale invasion of the city? Even Riven didn't do that!  <br> <br>Yasuo, thank you for guiding me and the team back home. I know things are different now… but I really hope you decide to stick around. Anima Squad needs you.  <br> <br>Illaoi, Xayah, and Leona! Without their strength and wisdom, I wouldn't be half the “little leader” I am!  <br> <br>To our newest teammate Briar, I speak for everyone when I say YOU'RE SO AWESOME. And if you think I don't speak for you… then I'll send my friend Jinx to make you agree.  <br> <br>Just kidding. Jinx!? Jinx, come back here!  <br> <br>…I should probably go make sure she doesn't actually hurt anybody.  <br> <br>*bzztt* Final City, this is Commander Fortune. Seraphine is right… though I might've worded things a bit differently. We've won a long and hard-fought battle.  <br> <br>The war isn't over. The Primordians are still out there, and so is Aatrox. But we're stronger now. More knowledgeable. And we've got a “Briar.”  <br> <br>When they come back, we'll be ready.",
